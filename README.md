# learn
code I wrote during learning something

## Disclamer
this repo does not contain a LICENSE file, because there may be code i wrote following along examples.   
The code may be not mine so i dont put a lisence in it.  

Dont consider this a project or sth like this. This is just for me, having a place to store all "learning code"
